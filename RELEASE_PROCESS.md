## Overview of OpenSearch Release process:
OpenSearch currently release major, minor and patch versions on a regular cadence as listed in this [release page](https://opensearch.org/releases.html). The infrastructure to build, test and release artifacts are available at https://build.ci.opensearch.org/. A public release GitHub issue using this [release template](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release_template.md) is created in the opensearch-build repo along with individual component GitHub issues created using this [template](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/component_release_template.md) for all plugins participating in the release. 

A primary release manager along with secondary release managers corresponding to participating repos are assigned for a release. Primary release manager goes over the individual release issues periodically across the repos and engage the secondary release managers to take appropriate action as needed throughout the release process. A release call is scheduled with required stakeholders to complete the release process.

## Release process:
* Step 1: Finalize the release plan and date for the release [ **PMC committee** ]
* Step 2: Assign Primary and secondary release managers to OpenSearch release through volunteer model  - ( 14 days from release date ) - [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 3: Validate if every team participating in a release has their release branch created for the corresponding release.  - (10 days from release date) -  [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 4: Modify distribution build job to use the release branch for generating release candidate instead of .x branches  - (10 days from release date)  [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 5: Validate and kick off the preparation phase for a release - (7 days from release date)  [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 6: Generate the release candidate ( 6 days from release date)  [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 7: Broadcast the release candidate to the community  (5 days from release date)  [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 8: Execute integration, BWC tests and performance test against the release candidate  ( 5 days from release date)  [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 9: Sanity test the release candidate and provide votes  [ **Repository manager, Maintainer** ]
* Step 10: Document the results from Step 4 and Step 5 along with the votes from community in release GitHub issue.  (Between 4  - 2 days from release date)  [ **Release manager**]
* Step 11: Finalize the release candidate and sign, stage the approved release candidate  (1 day from release date) [ **Release manager, PMC committee**]
* Step 12: Schedule a Go / No-GO call and get the sign off from required stakeholders [**Release manager, PMC committee**]
* Step 13: Schedule release meeting [**Release manager**]
* Step 14: Publish the approved artifacts to corresponding distribution channels after automated validation   (Release day) [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 15: Execute all post release activities (Release day!) [ **Release manager** ]
* Step 16: Broadcast the completion of release activities  [ **Release manager** ]


**Note**: We have published a [proposal](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/issues/150) to move away from release train model with defined release date to release window model with a defined release candidate (RC) creation date. We will use the 1st RC creation date as release day in the above steps if we end up moving to the new release model.
